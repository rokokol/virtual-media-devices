check-sh.sh — holds a shell script's help, documents and completions to its code

The help is the single source of truth for what a script accepts, so every subcommand its
dispatcher has, every flag its parsers take, every variable it reads and every code it
exits with must be in the help — and every document and completion that restates a list
is held to the same code, in both directions. Each check is proven able to fail on every
run, on a canonical script with one defect planted, so a copy falsifies itself wherever
it runs. It has no repo-specific part, and belongs in a repository's own gate

  check-sh.sh [-n NAME] [-e PREFIX] [-d DOC]... [-m DOC]... [-c BASH ZSH] SCRIPT
  check-sh.sh --template [script|bash|zsh]

  -n NAME      what the help, the docs and the completions call the script (default:
               the script's basename)
  -e PREFIX    the script reads environment variables with this prefix; each must be
               in the help
  -d DOC       a document that lists the script's subcommands, checked both ways: every
               subcommand named, and every `NAME word` it spells real; repeatable
  -m DOC       a document that mentions only some of them and sends the reader to the
               help for the rest: every `NAME word` it spells must be real; repeatable
  -c BASH ZSH  the two completion files, checked both ways
  -b, --bash-only
               run only the checks that ask this bash a question, and none that read the
               script as a tree; it needs no shfmt and no jq. It exists for a runner that
               has neither, says in the summary that the tree half was skipped, and is
               never chosen on its own — a missing tool is a refusal, not a quiet pass
  --template   print the canonical script, or its bash or zsh completion, and exit

The shapes it reads are the standard's own: a `case "$cmd"` dispatcher at the top level
with `-h | --help | help)` and a `*)` arm that sends usage to stderr, flag arms such as
`-n | --dry-run)` inside cmd_<sub>() functions or at the top level, literal `exit N`, a
help printed from a heredoc or by a `help [SUB]` subcommand, and a header comment that
lists nothing. They are spelled out in references/shape.md and help.md of
https://github.com/rokokol/bash-best-practices-skill. A header line claiming "Needs bash
X.Y" turns on a grep for constructs newer than that floor, and "POSIX tools only" one for
flags a BSD userland lacks or reads another way; a grep is a proxy, and the proof is a run
under the bash the claim names

CHECK_SH_NESTED=1 runs the checks and skips the self-test. The self-test runs itself that
way, and so should a gate that calls this script more than once in one run: the copy and
its tools are the same for every call, so proving it again proves nothing new. The first
call of every run keeps it: it is what notices a copy that stopped catching defects, and
the bash and tools under a copy change without the copy changing. A call with a finding
exits 1 before the self-test, so the call that keeps it is one that passes, and the
variable changes nothing on a call meant to go red

Nothing here reaches the network
Exit 0 when everything agrees, 1 with one `check-sh: <what>` line per finding, 2 on a
usage error, an unreadable file, a --help that fails, or a script with nothing to check

# rejects, which is why the claim is proven by a run under /bin/bash on a macOS runner
# and this is only the cheap first look. It runs before the help is asked for, since
# under a real 3.2 a script holding such a construct may not parse at all
# Each row below is the bash a construct needs and the pattern that finds it, and a script
# is held to the rows *above* the floor it declares: `Needs bash 4.3` is checked for 4.4
# and 5.2 constructs and left alone about `mapfile`. The floors are bash's own NEWS, and
# references/portability.md carries the same table in prose, for a reader rather than a grep
# The middle column says which copy of the code the pattern is read in. `cmd` is a command,
# which a string only names — `fail "this bash accepts declare -A"` is prose, and a gate
# proving a bash is 3.2 has to write that sentence — so those are matched where quoted text
# is blanked. `exp` is an expansion, which double quotes do not suppress: `echo "${v,,}"`
